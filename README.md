# Obsidian CSS Snippets

Backup of my CSS snippets for Obsidian.

## ✨️Features

- Made for Default / Minimal Theme.
- All snippets work independently.
- Use [Official CSS variables](https://docs.obsidian.md/Reference/CSS+variables/CSS+variables) as much as possible.

## Objective

- Maximize workspace.
- Focus on work.
- Minimize unnecessary UI.

## Maintenance

- Inactive snippets are removed to keep the repository clean.
